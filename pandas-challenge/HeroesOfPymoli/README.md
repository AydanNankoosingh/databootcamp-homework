An exploratory analysis of video game add-on purchasing data.

## How it Works

Using Python code organized in a Jupyter Notebook, a csv file containing purchasing data of video game add-ons is analyzed. Pandas are used to read the csv file and to create a number of summary tables including the most popular and profitable items, as well a demographic breakdown by age group and gender.

## Packages Used 
```python
import pandas as pd
```
