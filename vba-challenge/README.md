# Exploratory Analysis of Stock Market Data

A preliminary analysis of stock market data over a three year period using a Visual Basic script in Microsoft Excel.

## How it Works

The script searches through the daily open, close, high, low and trade volume by ticker symbol and displays summary statistics including the total stock price change, % change, and total trade volume over the course of each year. 

The output also includes conditional formatting based on stock performance, the greatest % increase and decrease in price, and the greatest traded volume for each year.
