# KickStarter Exploratory Data Analysis

An analysis of a database of 4000 Kickstarter campaigns using PivotTables and Charts in Microsoft Excel. The goal was to determine if there are any patterns associated with the Category, Fundraising Goal or Time of Launch and the likelihood of success of the campaign.

## Some Key Findings

i. Music (77%), Theatre (60%) and Film & Video (58%) campaigns appear to be the most successful categories on average, while Journalism (~0%) and Food (17%) campaigns tend to be the least successful.

ii. Kickstarter appears to be a relatively popular option for funding prospective playwrights with 1066 campaigns; the next highest is rock music with 260 campaigns. Kickstarter could be a good option for those trying to get an artistic project funded.

iii. In each year there appears to be a peak in successful campaigns between the months of March and May. There may be some benefit to launching a campaign in the Spring in terms of maximizing the probability of success. This is worth further investigation
