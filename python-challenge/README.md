# Part 1: Analysis of Monthly P/L Data

An analysis of monthly Profit/Loss data using Python fundamentals.

## How it Works

The script reads a csv file using csv.reader() and loops through a two-column data set using list comprehensions. A summary is then printed to the console as well as to a text file, identifying the max, min and average monthly profit.

## Packages Used 
```python
import csv
```
